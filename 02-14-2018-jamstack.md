# JAMstack PWA - Up and Running with Gatsby.js, Firebase, and Netlify

## What is JAMstack?

As defined on [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/):

> `JAMstack`: noun \â€™jam-stakâ€™\
> Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

Paraphrased: JAMstack is a way of architecting your web applications with three key principals:

1. The client-side javascript handles all data fetching.
2. The APIs the client depend on, such as databases, authentication services, asset CDNs, etc., are abstracted into CORS enabled microservices to be accessable from the client-side javascript.
3. Markup is prerendered at _build-time_, though not required, usually done with a static site generator.

## Cool story. But why?

### Performance

With the markup being rendered at build-time, there is no server runtime to generate the markup. The HTML files are already there ready to be sent over to the client. Granted the performance gains here aren't groundbreaking as most web server implementations utilize caching, but any gains to time to first byte is a plus.

### Cost

Again, since there's no server runetime and all that's being served are some static assets, the assets can be stored on and served from a CDN. Meaning costs to deploy your site are low and with some services like Netlify (which we'll cover later) can even be free.

### Developer experience

With the backend services abstracted away into their own APIs, the front-end engineer has free reign over what tools, libraries, frameworks, languages, etc. to utilzie on the front-end. There are no restriction on what preprocessed languages or build tools can be used. Personally, I think the tools the node.js community have developed are second to none when it comes to developer expirience. Webpack has enabled things like [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/]). I know and love the development workflow node.js projects have to offer and often find myself longing for those tools when working on projects with what I consider an inferior development expirience.

## About the app we're building

Today we'll be building a simple polling application. Authenticated users will be able to create a poll with some options that they in turn can share with a generated link. Users visiting that link can then choose one of the options and have their selection reflected on the results in real time.

## The Dev Stack

* [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): Gatsby makes use of React.js to generate both the markup and javascript. It enables developers to fetch data from any data source and declaratively pull that data into their components using GraphQL.
* [Firebase firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/): A noSQL database that also exposes listerners for real time updates whenever data changes.
* [Firebase auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/): To authenticate users via OAuth 2.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Netlify is a global CDN that makes continuous deployments as simple as a few clicks.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter.
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Javascript linting.

All tools used in this tutorial are free or have an incredibly genereous free tier, so feel free to follow along.

## Getting Started

Create a new directory, cd into, initialize git, and initialize yarn or npm.

`mkdir polling-app && cd polling-app && git init && yarn init -y`

> altnernatively, if you prefer using npm: `npm init -y`
