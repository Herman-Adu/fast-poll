# JAMstack PWA - Let's Build a Polling App. with Gatsby.js, Firebase, and Styled-components Pt. 1

In this two-part tutorial, I'll show you how to get up and running with a progressive web application (PWA) that makes use of a powerful web architecture pattern called the JAMstack. We'll start out initializing the project with linting and code formatting, building out the UI of our application, and finally, we'll deploy it to the web.

## What is JAMstack?

As defined on [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/):

> `JAMstack`: noun \’jam-stak’\
> Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

Paraphrased: JAMstack is a way of architecting your web applications with three key principals:

1. The client-side javascript handles all data fetching.
2. The APIs the client(s) depend on, such as any databases, authentication services, asset CDNs, etc., are abstracted into CORS enabled microservices to be accessible from the client-side.
3. Markup is prerendered at _build-time_, though not required, usually done with a static site generator.

## Cool story. But why?

### Performance

With the markup being rendered at build-time, there is no server runtime to generate the markup. The HTML files are already there ready to be sent over to the client. Granted the performance gains here aren't groundbreaking as most web server implementations utilize page caching, but any gains to time to first byte is a plus.

### Cost

Again, since there's no server runtime and all that's being served are some static assets, the assets can be stored on and served from a CDN. Meaning costs to deploy your site are low and with some services like Netlify (which we'll cover later) can even be free.

### SEO

Generally speaking, you want web crawlers to have an as easy of a job possible indexing your website. Amongst other reasons, this is why implementing server-side rendering or pre-rendering on your single-page-application is a plus. This way, web crawlers don't have to wait for javascript to be parsed and ran before the markup can be indexed, the markup will already exist inside the HTML file. This is not to say SPAs are not crawled by search engines, however, there are edge cases that make it difficult.

### Developer experience

With the backend services abstracted away into their own APIs, the front-end engineer has free reign over what tools, libraries, frameworks, and languages to utilize on the front-end. There are no restriction on what preprocessed languages or build tools can be used as the case with some web frameworks. Personally, I think the tools the Node.js community have developed are second to none when it comes to DX. Tools like Webpack have enabled things like [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/]). I know and love the development workflow Node.js projects have to offer and often find myself longing for those tools when working on projects with what I consider inferior development tooling.

## About the app we're building

We'll be building a simple polling application. Authenticated users will be able to create a poll with some options that they, in turn, can share with a generated link. Users visiting that link can then choose one of the options and have their selection reflected on the results in real time.

## The Front-end Stack

* [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): Gatsby makes use of React.js's server-side rendering capabilities to generate markup at build time. Though not covered in this tutorial, it also enables developers to fetch data from any data source and declaratively pull that data into their components using GraphQL so that the components can be hydrated with data at build time. To get a better idea of all of Gatsby.js's capabilities, check out [this link](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/).
* [Firebase firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/): A noSQL cloud database that exposes event listeners for real-time updates whenever data changes via an intuitive and easy to use web SDK.
* [Firebase auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/): Used to authenticate users via OAuth 2. Like firestore, Firebase auth has a web SDK that handles all of the nitty gritty details of OAuth2 authentication for you.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Netlify is a global CDN that makes continuous deployments as simple as a few clicks. Deploying with Netlify is as easy as it comes.
* [Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/): A react-specific css-in-js solution. This is just one of many css-in-js solutions out there. Another library worth mentioning is [Glamorous](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous). I just prefer styled-components.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter.
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Javascript linting.

All tools used in this tutorial are free or have an incredibly generous free tier, so feel free to follow along.

## Getting Started - Project Setup

Let's get started! Install `gatsby-cli` globally, then run `gatsby new polling-app` and initialize `git` inside the new directory.

> Gatsby.js requires node v4.0.0 plus, before continuing, check your version of Node by running `node -v` in your terminal of choice. I'd recommend installing, at least, the latest version of Node LTS found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```
npm install --global gatsby-cli && gatsby new polling-app && cd polling-app && git init
```

> I won't be covering any git workflows in this tutorial, however, at the end of the tutorial we'll set up Netlify with git for continuous deployments.

Let's now set up ESLint. I generally like to install [Airbnb's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) ESLint config, then just override the rules I don't like. Install Airbnb's config and peer dependencies. If you're on Linux/OSX, just copy and paste this script into your terminal:

```
(
  export PKG=eslint-config-airbnb;
  npm info "$PKG@latest" peerDependencies --json | command sed 's/[\{\},]//g ; s/: /@/g' | xargs npm install --save-dev "$PKG@latest"
)
```

> If you're on windows, head over to Airbnb's ESLint config repository linked above and there will be directions on how to get those dependancies installed.

Install other ESLint peer-dependancies as well as prettier:

```
npm install -D babel-eslint eslint-config-react eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier prettier
```

> -D specifies that these are development dependencies.

Add a `.eslintrc` file to the root of your project and paste in these rules. Anything you don't like, you can just override under `rules`.

```json
{
  "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": [
      "error",
      { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }
    ],
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": 0,
    "react/require-default-props": 0,
    "react/prefer-stateless-function": 1,
    "no-shadow": 0,
    "arrow-body-style": 0,
    "consistent-return": 0,
    "no-console": 1,
    "no-case-declarations": 0,
    "import/prefer-default-export": 0
  },
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "settings": {
    "import/core-modules": ["react", "prop-types"]
  },
  "globals": {
    "graphql": true
  },
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2017,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "es6": true,
    "browser": true,
    "node": true
  }
}
```

Do the same for a `.prettierrc` file:

```json
{
  "printWidth": 80,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "write": "src/**/*.js",
  "jsxBracketSameLine": true
}
```

Since we're specifying our own prettier rules here, go to your `package.json` and remove the rules passed in as flags under `scripts.format`, generated by gatsby-cli. By default, prettier will check for a `.prettierrc` file in the root of the project and use those rules.

`"format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx}\""`

While we're at it, let's add a script for ESLint:

`"lint": "eslint **/*.{js,jsx} --quiet"`

> --quiet flag specifies that only errors are to be reported, not warnings. This is optional.

> [Optional] For a better development experience, I'd suggest installing the plugins for your IDE/Code editor. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).

## Gatsby Project Structure

Let's cover the directory structure generated by gatsby-cli.

* `./src/pages/` is a required directory. `./src/pages/index.js` corresponds to the root path of the website. So the component defined in `index.js` is rendered on `www.mysite.com/`. The only other file that has a predefined name is `404.js`. This page is rendered anytime a user navigates to a page that does not exist. All other files in this directory have their filenames corresponding to the site's path. `./src/pages/page-2` can be found in [localhost:8000/page-2/](http://localhost:8000/page-2/). Nested paths can be created by adding a sub-directory inside `./src/pages`. For example `./src/pages/polls/new.js` would be `www.mysite.com/polls/new`. In my opinion, this API is very intuitive and works great for most cases.
* `./src/layouts/`: Files are optional, but have a specific purpose as defined by Gatsby. To keep things simple, we're only concerned with `./src/layouts/index.js`. This file is wrapped around _all_ page components inside `./src/pages`. This would be the place to insert your Header and Footer components assuming _all_ of your pages have a header and footer.
* `./src/components/`: This is where you place your custom components and how you structure this directory is up to you. Technically, your components don't even have to be in this directory, but this is the usual convention. I use this directory for my stateless functional components.

## Gatsby Plugins

Gatsby has quite a bit of official and community plugins that make integrating many common tools or libraries a breeze. One of which is [gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/). Let's look into how to add a plugin to a Gatsby project.

Install `gatsby-plugin-styled-components` as well as `styled-components`:

```
npm install gatsby-plugin-styled-components styled-components
```

Open up `gatsby-config.js` in the root of your project. As you can see we already have a plugin being used. `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet` is added by gatsby-cli's default starter. Add `gatsby-plugin-styled-components` as another item in the `plugins` array. While we're at it, update `siteMetadata.title` to our site's title.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: 'Polling App',
  },
  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-react-helmet', 'gatsby-plugin-styled-components'],
};
```

> For these two particular plugins, the order does not matter. However, be aware there are some plugins that need to be placed before or after other plugins. Just whenever adding a plugin, be sure to read the documentation, otherwise, you might get some unexpected behavior.

> Whenever adding plugins you may have to restart your development server.

You can read more about plugins in Gatsby.js [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/#plugins).

## Getting our hands dirty

Let's actually write some code! Start the development server by running `npm run develop`. We're going to build out the landing page for our site. Go ahead and delete `src/pages/page-2.js` assuming your version of `gatsby-cli` generated that file, we won't be needing it. Also, delete the `<Link>` component in `pages/index.js` as that pages no longer exists.

We're keeping `./src/layouts/index.css` as it has some sensible CSS resets.

Next, let's modify the Header component a bit. Change the Header title from Gatsby to something creative and original - like "Polling App". Now let's move the inline styles to be instead handled by `styled-components`. Your Header file should now look like this:

```jsx
// ./src/components/Header/index.js
import React from 'react';
import Link from 'gatsby-link';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const HeaderContainer = styled.header`
  ${props => props.background};
  margin-bottom: 1.45rem;
`;

const HeaderWrapper = styled.div`
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 960px;
  padding: 1.45rem 1.0875rem;
`;

const Heading1 = styled.h1`
  margin: 0;
`;

const StyledLink = styled(Link)`
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
`;

const BACKGROUND = 'background-color: #20232a';

const Header = ({ background }) => (
  <HeaderContainer background={background}>
    <HeaderWrapper>
      <Heading1>
        <StyledLink to="/">Polling App</StyledLink>
      </Heading1>
    </HeaderWrapper>
  </HeaderContainer>
);

Header.defaultProps = {
  background: BACKGROUND,
};

Header.propTypes = {
  background: PropTypes.string,
};

export default Header;
```

A couple things to note here:

1. The weird opening and closing backticks (\`\`) after `styled`. These are [template literal's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), just being used in a lesser known way. It enables front-end developers to use actual CSS property names as opposed to their camelCase counterparts required by javascript.
2. Because of this unusual use of template literals, most IDEs and code editors do not have built-in syntax highlighting for the CSS defined inside the template literal strings. [Here's a link](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/tooling#syntax-highlighting) where can check if your favorite editor has a syntax highlighting plugin for styled-components.
3. The `styled(Link)` component: this is a higher order function that passes the processed styles within the template literals to the wrapped component. This can work with any 3rd party component so long as the wrapped component passes `props.style` to a child DOM element.
4. `background` being passed to the `HeaderContainer` styled-component. This is what makes styled-components powerful. It allows you to pass in dynamic data to your components' styles giving you flexibility with your styling that you otherwise wouldn't have with regular .css files.

Another thing to note is the styled-component we defined as `HeaderContainer` has almost the exact same styles as the element wrapping `props.children()` inside `./src/layouts/index.js`. This is an opportunity to keep our code DRY. Create a directory called `styledComponents` inside the `./src/` directory. A convention I follow with styled-components is anytime I have a styled-component that is reusable, I extract it into its own file inside `./src/styledComponents/`.
Since this styled-component is being used for layout, let's put it in a file called `layout.js`. I think an appropriate name for this specific styled-component is `Container`. Cut the `HeaderContainer` declaration and paste it into `./src/styledComponents/layout.js`, rename it to `Container`, and export it.

```javascript
// ./src/styledComponents/layout.js
import styled from 'styled-components';

export const Container = styled.div`
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 960px;
  padding: 1.45rem 1.0875rem;
`;
```

> Don't wrap styled-components defined here in a function as you might with a stateless functional component in `./src/components/`. You'll see why in a bit.

In `./src/components/Header/index.js` import the newly created `Container` styled-component and replace the `HeaderWrapper` styled-component with it.

```javascript
import { Container } from '../../styledComponents/layout';
...
const Header = ({ background }) => (
  <HeaderContainer background={background}>
    <Container>
      <Heading1>
        <StyledLink to="/">Polling App</StyledLink>
      </Heading1>
    </Container>
  </HeaderContainer>
);
...
```

Now, header over to `./src/layouts/index.js` import `Container` from `'../styledComponents/layout.js'` and replace the `<div>` with inline styles with it. Before doing so, notice that this element has a `paddingTop: 0` rule set. Our `Container` component, however, defines `padding-top` with `1.45rem`. Let's override that `padding-top` with a handy helper method defined on all styled-components `.extend`. `.extend`... well extends the CSS defined on a component allowing you to define a base set of styling rules on a component and extend those rules whenever needed.

While we're at it, let's spruce up that boring `Header` background-color! _(Shameless plug time)_ - Head over to [www.grabient.com](https://www.grabient.com/) and grab yourself a gradient, be sure to untick `prefixes` as styled-components already handles all vendor prefixes for you. Pass the gradient you chose that you copied into your clipboard as the `background` prop we defined inside our `Header` component.

```javascript
// ./src/layouts/index.js
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import Helmet from 'react-helmet';

import Header from '../components/Header';
import { Container as BaseContainerStyles } from '../styledComponents/layout';

import './index.css';

const Container = BaseContainerStyles.extend`
  padding-top: 0;
`;

const TemplateWrapper = ({ children }) => (
  <div>
    <Helmet
      title="Gatsby Default Starter"
      meta={[
        { name: 'description', content: 'Sample' },
        { name: 'keywords', content: 'sample, something' },
      ]}
    />
    <Header background="background-image: linear-gradient(116deg, #08AEEA 0%, #2AF598 100%)" />
    <Container>{children()}</Container>
  </div>
);

TemplateWrapper.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.func,
};

export default TemplateWrapper;
```

## Pulling data into components at built-time

Recall there being `siteMetadata.title` defined in `./gatsby-config.js`, let's use that value as our site's title defined in the `Helmet`. To do so we'll make use of the GraphQL api gatsby exposes to use to pull data into our components at build-time. I won't be covering any details on GraphQL today, however, if you're unfamiliar with GraphQL and interested in learning more, [here's an awesome resource to learn](http://graphql.org/learn/).

Let's update the `./src/layouts/index.js` file:

```javascript
// ./src/layouts/index.js
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import Helmet from 'react-helmet';

import Header from '../components/Header';
import { Container as BaseContainerStyles } from '../styledComponents/layout';

import './index.css';

const Container = BaseContainerStyles.extend`
  padding-top: 0;
`;

const TemplateWrapper = ({ children, data }) => (
  <div>
    <Helmet
      title={data.site.siteMetadata.title}
      meta={[
        { name: 'description', content: 'Sample' },
        { name: 'keywords', content: 'sample, something' },
      ]}
    />
    <Header
      background="background-image: linear-gradient(116deg, #08AEEA 0%, #2AF598 100%)"
      title={data.site.siteMetadata.title}
    />
    <Container>{children()}</Container>
  </div>
);

TemplateWrapper.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.func,
  data: PropTypes.object,
};

export const query = graphql`
  query AboutQuery {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`;

export default TemplateWrapper;
```

We're also passing that title the `Header` component, feel to update it so that it uses our site title as the `Heading1` component text.

Test it out! Watch that Gatsby.js magic update the site title as well as the `Header` when you save the `./gatsby-config.js` with an updated title. Things like this are the reason why I love developing with Gatsby and other Webpack-built projects.

## The index page

Now let's create the landing page for our polling app. Let's add some content that will really sell our polling application, after all, it's going to be way better than anything out there already. We'll also need a sign-in button and perhaps a call-to-action button to create a poll.

> From now on I'm not going to focus as much on `styled-components` or styling at all for that matter, I feel like I've shown you enough to give you an idea of what styled-components is capable of. To find out more head over to the styled-components website found [here](https://www.styled-components.com/).

Add a `Button` to a new file in `./src/styledComponents/` called `theme.js`:

```javascript
// ./src/styledComponents/theme.js
import styled from 'styled-components';

export const Button = styled.button`
  padding: 5px 25px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(116deg, #08aeea 0%, #2af598 100%);
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border: none;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  filter: hue-rotate(0deg);
  transition: filter 300ms linear;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:focus,
  &:hover {
    filter: hue-rotate(45deg);
  }
`;
```

I also suspect we'll reuse the `Heading2` component located inside the index page. Let's create a file `typography.js` inside `./src/styledComponents/`:

```javascript
// ./src/styledComponents/typography.js
import styled from 'styled-components';

export const Heading2 = styled.h2`
  text-transform: capitalize;
`;
```

Now update our `index.js` page:

```javascript
// ./src/pages/index.js
import React from 'react';
import Link from 'gatsby-link';

import { Button } from '../styledComponents/theme';
import { Heading2 } from '../styledComponents/typography';

const IndexPage = () => (
  <div>
    <Heading2>A next-generation polling application</Heading2>
    <p>
      Built from the ground up - Ut pariatur velit eu fugiat ut. Veniam commodo
      non esse proident ut anim irure voluptate commodo aliqua tempor Lorem

    </p>
    <Link to="/new">
      <Button>New Poll</Button>
    </Link>
  </div>
);

export default IndexPage;
```

## The NewPoll Page

Let's go ahead and install a few dependencies we'll need.

```
npm install react-sortable-hoc short-id
```

We'll use `short-id` to generate ids for each new option added and eventually the id for each poll. `react-sortable-hoc` will be used so that the creator of a poll can change the order of his poll options if he so chooses.

Create a new `index.js` file inside `./src/components/NewPoll/`

```javascript
// ./src/components/NewPoll/index.js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import {
  SortableContainer,
  SortableElement,
  SortableHandle,
} from 'react-sortable-hoc';

const OptionsContainer = styled.ul`
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0 0 30px;
`;

const OptionItemContainer = styled.li`
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 10px 60px 10px 20px;
  margin: 0 0 10px;
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  list-style: none;
  position: relative;
  min-height: 36px;
`;

const OptionInputItem = styled.input`
  border: none;
  background-color: inherit;
  width: 100%;
`;

const ActionItem = styled.div`
  position: absolute;
  right: ${props => (props.right ? `${props.right}px` : '10px')};
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  cursor: ${props => (props.editing ? 'pointer' : 'move')};
`;

const DragHandle = SortableHandle(() => <ActionItem>:::</ActionItem>);

const SortableItem = SortableElement(
  ({ text, id, onToggleEdit, onKeyDown, onTextChange, onDelete, editing }) => (
    <OptionItemContainer
      key={id}
      onDoubleClick={() => !editing && onToggleEdit(id)}
      onBlur={() => onToggleEdit(id)}>
      {editing ? (
        <OptionInputItem
          autoFocus
          value={text}
          onChange={e => onTextChange(e, id)}
          onKeyDown={onKeyDown}
        />
      ) : (
        text
      )}
      <ActionItem
        editing
        onClick={() => onDelete(id)}
        right={40}
        title="Delete">
        x
      </ActionItem>
      <DragHandle />
    </OptionItemContainer>
  ),
);

const SortableList = SortableContainer(({ options, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <OptionsContainer>
      {options.map((option, index) => {
        return (
          <SortableItem {...option} {...props} index={index} key={option.id} />
        );
      })}
    </OptionsContainer>
  );
});

const NewPoll = props => (
  <SortableList {...props} lockAxis="y" useDragHandle lockToContainerEdges />
);

NewPoll.propTypes = {
  options: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.object).isRequired,
  onToggleEdit: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onTextChange: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onKeyDown: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onSortEnd: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onDelete: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

export default NewPoll;
```

Let's go ahead and add a `new.js` page in `./src/pages/` that acts as the container to this component to get things working!

```javascript
// ./src/pages/new.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import Link from 'gatsby-link';
import { arrayMove } from 'react-sortable-hoc';
import shortId from 'short-id';

import { Button } from '../styledComponents/theme';
import { Heading2 } from '../styledComponents/typography';
import NewPoll from '../components/NewPoll/index';

const CreateButton = Button.extend`
  background-image: linear-gradient(19deg, #21d4fd 0%, #b721ff 100%);
  margin-left: 20px;
`;

const ActionContainer = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
`;

class NewPollPage extends Component {
  state = {
    options: [
      {
        text: 'option1',
        id: '123avcs232',
        editing: false,
      },
      {
        text: 'option2',
        id: '123av35df2',
        editing: false,
      },
      {
        text: 'option3',
        id: '12323dsdsv35df2',
        editing: false,
      },
      {
        text: 'option4',
        id: 'ac24312v35df2',
        editing: false,
      },
    ],
  };
  // to keep track of what item is being edited
  editing = null;

  handleKeydown = e => {
    if (e.which === 27) this.handleToggleEdit(this.editing);
    if (e.which === 13) this.handleAddItem();
  };

  handleToggleEdit = id => {

In reality, all we've got here is a basic to-do app with some client-side CRUD operations. But at least we've made some really good progress towards the final product! That concludes part 1 of this tutorial. In the next part, we'll build out the poll page, set up Firebase authentication and firestore, make our app work offline, deploy our app with Netlify, and finally run some [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tests to see if we made what can be considered a Progressive Web App. Be sure to follow us for more blogs every Monday and Tuesday! We'll have part 2 out for you in no time. See ya!
